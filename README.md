# Tombraiding-Internship
 
 Tombraiding Internship is a game made for the RUB AI GameJam 

In the Tombraiding Internship, you play as a young archaeologist on her first field assignment. To ensure that you are not completely unprepared for the ancient tombs, your professor is connected to you via Zoomâ„¢ and provides you with helpful tips and translations. If you ever forget some important information, you can find it in your notes [TAB].
